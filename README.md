# MERN Hotel Booking APPLICATION

Hi! My name is **Tushar Biswas**, I have developed this hotel booking application.

# Install Dependencies

**For Backend** - `npm i`

**For Frontend** - `cd frontend` ` npm i`

## Env Variables
Make Sure to add appropriate variables (create "config.env" file in "./backend/config" directory and ".env" file in "./frontend" directory) in order to use the app.

## Backend variables
I've added "config.env.sample" file in "./backend/config" folder. Just rename it to "config.env" and add the remaining vaiables. 

## Frontend variables
I've added "env.sample" file in "./frontend" folder. Just rename it to ".env" and modify the remaining vaiables. 



## For deployment in production
If you want to deploy the application in production then make sure to build the frontend with "npm run build" command at "./frontend" directory. And finally put all the vairables from "./backend/config.env.sample.production" to the environment variable fields & fill the value.
